Small Project to have a more comfortable backup on my windows Tablet.
Also a great opportunity to get some pathlib training. 
I then used pyinstaller to run it on the Tablet- using a yaml File
for steering. This file should be in the home folder of the user. 
As the main purpose of this script is photo backups it will 
move the files in seperated folders per file type.
